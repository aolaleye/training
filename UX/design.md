__Design Thinking__
- gaining insights into your users experience as you design, develop or sell your services to your users
- __AS-IS__
  - what a user is currently experiencing
- __TO-BE__
  - an empathy-based solution that addresses their greatest experience pain points
- __Timeboxing__
  - the act of defining a length of time that a task should take and enforcing those parameters
  - it's not only a means of timekeeping but it also aids in breaking design thinking workshop methods into realistically manageable pieces
- design thinking is centered around your user, but also moving quickly and creatively
- Mindsets vs Methods
  - __You are NOT your user__
    - it is important to separate your own biases and assumptions from the process and learn what your user truly needs
  - __Empathy Map__
    - a design thinking tool made of quadrants that is used to better understand the overarching traits of a user - typically outside of the context of their workflow
    - it can create a "snapshot" of the user mentality
    - empathy maps aren't an exact representation of a single specific human being - they are a way for us to consider a user archetype
  - __Archetype__
    - a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in indvidual psyches
    - i.e. an urban college student is up on the latest tech trends or a rural babyboomer who just became a grandma
    - there are certain things that can be inferred about the lives or habits of an archetype, but _they are just assumptions until we prove them right or wrong_
  - __Journey Map__
    - a means of documenting a user's experience from start-to-finish
    - vary from practitioner to practitioner
    - seek to find a user's pain, their motivations, or design opportunities for a user
    - this may be likened to an empathy map but viewed over the course of an experieince rather than a general view of a user during a single point in time
  - __Pain Points__
    - blockers in a user's experience
    - this may be emotional, technological, process-based or physical
    - severity of pain will vary with each example
  - __Prioritization__
    - defining the importance of action items
  - __Triage__
    - acting upon the prioritized action items taking care of the most important items first
  - __Big Idea__
    - a holistic and open-ended solution to a user's pain based in a user's motivation or needs
  - __Feature__
    - a prescriptive non-holistic response to a user's pain based in technology
  - __Vignette__
    - a brief but descriptive depiction of events
  - __"Getting Caught in the Weeds"__
    - an idiom that refers to being distracted by details and losing sight of the intended purpose
  - __Self-compassion__
    - allowing for kindness and mindful forgiveness of oneself during times of failure
  - __Storyboard__
    - a visual form of storytelling used to show a user's journey
    - comporesed of panels filled with art (high or low fidelity) and accompanying text
- __Presenting your Findings__
  - __Roadmap__
    - a time-based mapping of design decisions and the user impact of those decisions
  - Three things to remember when structuring your stakeholder presentation
    1. Simple Story
      - keep the story tight and easy to follow
    2. Maintain Empathy
      - use your user's name to maintain empathy with your audience and to guide the narrative
    3. Solve the Pain
      - explain how your solution solves your user's pain
  - Time Management
    - be sure to set enough time to better the story so you're telling the points that matter most for you
  - Story First
    - attractive visuals may distract from your story, so consider the fidelity in which you communicate your story
    - if you're early in the process, keep the fidelity low 
    - if you're further along, then higher fidelity images would make sense
  - Getting Feedback
    - go into the presentation with the intent of getting feedback
    - rather than opening up the floor asking for general feedback, begin the Q&A section with fairly directed questions aimed at the top stakeholders
      - this will let them know what you actually want feedback on and you will maintain the ability of actually running the meeting
    
__Understanding the Different Types of Design__
- __The 3 Principles of Architecture (Vitruvius)__
  1. __Durability__
    - it should last
  2. __Usability__
    - it should have purpose
  3. __Beauty__
    - it should appear delightful
- __Graphic Design__
  - the design of visual communication
  - where we can take a message and correlate it with the elements of art to relay a message
  - where we can change peoples' perception or thoughts on a particular message
  - _"turning a want into a need"_
- __Web/Mobile Design - User Interface__
  - there are two levels of desing when dealing with web a mobile design:
  1. __the design of the content__
    - which you are there to see
  2. __the design of the interface (UI Design)__
    - designing specifically for the user's interactions - meaning you have the content already in hand and are you are performing the task of serving that content up
    - presenting the user with the best possible solution for them to view and interact with the content
- __Systems Design - User Experience__
  - defining objects and how the interaction presents and forms data - thus a system based on requirements
  - can be comprised of multiple mediums

__Great Designers__
  - Charles and Ray Eames
    - main focus was architecture and furniture
    - "Powers of Ten"
      - the zoom effect we still see today in movies
    - "Eames Lounge Chair"
  - Herb Lubalin
    - collaborated on 3 Ginzburg magazines - Eros, Fact and Avant Garde
    - changed the perception of typography through his exploration of typographics
  - Paul Rand
    - created brand identities for major corporations including Apple, ABC, Enron, ups
  - Saul Bass
    - motion graphics, title sequences, corporate logos
    - corporate identites for many big companies
  - Erik Spiekermann
    - known as one of the best typographers
  - Dieter Rams
    - industrial designer that send the ground work for the term "user friendly"
    - created the Ten Principles of Good Design
      - Good Design...
        1. is innovative
        2. makes a product useful
        3. is aesthetic
        4. makes a product understandable
        5. is unobtrusive
        6. is honest
        7. is long-lasting
        8. is thorough down to the last detail
        9. is environmentally friendly
        10. is as little design as possible
        
__Understanding Aesthetics__
- __Format, Line & Shape__
  - __Format__
    - _the blank substance all designs start out with - whether it be a blank piece of paper or a blank file_
    - these formats all have size and shape even if its digital
    - this space is called the "format of the design" - where everything is arranged
    - the format of the design can portray the overall mood of the design
    - __the format always needs to be considered before beginning the design__
    - every two-dimensional design has two parts:
      1. __Picture Plane__
        - the space where the design is taking place
      2. __the Frame__
        - the outer edge of the picture plane
        - specifies where the design ends
        - the frame can be visible or implied
        - it can have a visual indicator or a contrast
  -__Line__
    - a long narrow mark or band passing through a point
    - __Point__
      - in most cases a line has a beginning and end point
      - the connection between the start and stop points is the line
      - you can have multiple points in one path
    - __Arc__
      - a line that has two points, but the line can bend away from the points, then reaching the end point
    - Thickness = Weight
    - Distance from start to stop = Length
    - There are different variations to lines:
      - __Organic__
      - __Symmetrical__
      - __Rough__
      - __Jagged__
    - __Line Variety__ is a mixture of these variations
    _ __Contour Lines__ - creating illustrations just using lines
    - We can have _organized_ or _unorganized_ lines
    - You can use _negative space_ to show where a line may be
    - When dealing with graphic dsign, a lot of designers use a __Grid__ - which is comprised of horizontal and vertical lines
