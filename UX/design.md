__Design Thinking__
- gaining insights into your users experience as you design, develop or sell your services to your users
- __AS-IS__
  - what a user is currently experiencing
- __TO-BE__
  - an empathy-based solution that addresses their greatest experience pain points
- __Timeboxing__
  - the act of defining a length of time that a task should take and enforcing those parameters
  - it's not only a means of timekeeping but it also aids in breaking design thinking workshop methods into realistically manageable pieces
- design thinking is centered around your user, but also moving quickly and creatively
- Mindsets vs Methods
  - __You are NOT your user__
    - it is important to separate your own biases and assumptions from the process and learn what your user truly needs
  - __Empathy Map__
    - a design thinking tool made of quadrants that is used to better understand the overarching traits of a user - typically outside of the context of their workflow
    - it can create a "snapshot" of the user mentality
    - empathy maps aren't an exact representation of a single specific human being - they are a way for us to consider a user archetype
  - __Archetype__
    - a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in indvidual psyches
    - i.e. an urban college student is up on the latest tech trends or a rural babyboomer who just became a grandma
    - there are certain things that can be inferred about the lives or habits of an archetype, but _they are just assumptions until we prove them right or wrong_
  - __Journey Map__
    - a means of documenting a user's experience from start-to-finish
    - vary from practitioner to practitioner
    - seek to find a user's pain, their motivations, or design opportunities for a user
    - this may be likened to an empathy map but viewed over the course of an experieince rather than a general view of a user during a single point in time
  - __Pain Points__
    - blockers in a user's experience
    - this may be emotional, technological, process-based or physical
    - severity of pain will vary with each example
