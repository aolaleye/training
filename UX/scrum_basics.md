__Before Agile methods were introduced__
- __The Waterfall Model__
    - a consistent sequence of stages to design, build and test software
    - Design --> Build --> Test
    - __Problems__
        - time and resources wasted in handoff between stages
        - product does not fit original intent
        - difficult to respond to change
