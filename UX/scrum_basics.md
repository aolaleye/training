__What is Agile?__
- __Before Agile methods were introduced__
    - __The Waterfall Model__
        - a consistent sequence of stages to design, build and test software
        - Design --> Build --> Test
        - __Problems__
            - time and resources wasted in handoff between stages
            - product does not fit original intent
            - difficult to respond to change
__The Agile Manifesto__
    - encourages teams to think about how to break down the silos that separate people working on a project, giving people formal roles and responsibilities and providing expectations for collaboration
        - __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools
        - __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation
        - __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation
        - __Responding to change__ over following a plan
__Varients of "Agile"__
    - Scrum
    - Lean and Kanban
    - Extreme Programming (XP)
    - and many more

__Introducing Scrum__
- __What is Scrum?__
    - an agile model consisting of a well-defined framework for carrying out software development in teams
    - a framework for working as a team in a series of iterations
- __The Roles of Scrum__
    - Product owner
        - serves as the voice of the customer and maintains the product backlog
        - responsible for figuring out what the team should work on in what order and spends a lot of time talking to other people in the organization and customers
        - a __Stakeholder__ is someone who works outside of the scrum team who has a say in what the product should be
            - this could be someone inside of the organization like a manager or leader or someone outside of the organization like a customer or client
        - the product owner must consult stakeholders to understand the product and its priorites
    - Scrum master
        - responsible for making sure the work of the team goes smoothly by facillitating scrum and removing impedements to the team
    - Development team members
        - members of the team who write and test code
        - responsible for self-assigning tasks and checking their work on each item against the item's conditions of acceptance
- __What is a Sprint__
    - the sprint is the basic unit of work for a Scrum team, and it may be the feature of Scrum that most differentiates it from other Agile models
    - __a sprint is a single iteration carried out by the team__
    - a team may complete several sprints on its way to preparing a release of software
    - __the length of a sprint is no longer that one month__ 
        - sometimes referred to as a __Time Box__ - the allotted time of the sprint agreed upon by the team
        - the duration of a sprint can be a small a one week
    - each sprint typically has the same duration which allows the team to form a rhythm or __Cadence__ to their work
    - a new sprint begins immediately after the previous sprint is completed

__Scrum Events__
- __Spring Planning__
    - scrum team meeting that recurs during each spring
    - the team gathers to prepare for a new sprint and decide exactly which items will go into the sprint
- __Daily Standups__
    - daily check-ins where each team member reports progess, next tasks, and issues impending progress
    - typically 15 minutes or lesss
    - key questions asked are:
        - __What did you do yesterday?__
        - __What do you plan to do today?__
        - __What obstacles are slowing you down?__
    - when a topic comes up during stand-up that requires extended time, it is moved to the "sidebar" and followed up with after the stand-up
- __Backlog Refinement__
    - product owner reviews product backlog items with the team for clarification and revision
    - the team estimates the effort of each item
    - user stories
        - a special product backlog item that describes who would use the feature and why
    - planning poker
        - a "game" where each team member uses a card to show thei estimate of the work involved in an item
- __Sprint Review__
    - the sprint product is demonstrated to the stakeholders
    - team gathers with stakeholders to demonstrate working software in the form of the sprint product
- __Retrospective__
    - team gathers to reflect on the work of the sprint and identify something they can attempt to improve in the next sprint
        - __What went well?__
        - __What could have gone better?__
        - __What can we change?__

__Scrum Artifacts__
- __User Stories__
    - special product backlog items that tell you more than just how a feature behaves, but what is happening for the user
    - the value of the user story is defined by _who_ the user is, _what_ they need, and _why_ they need it
        - _As a _________
        - _I need _________
        - _so that _________
- __The Product Backlog__
    - an ordered list of all the items a team might work 
    - the highest priority items are on the top and the lower priority items are further down the list
- __Sprint Backlog__
    - items are taken from the top of the product backlog and are accepted into a sprint
- __The Taskboard__
    - many teams break sprint backlog items into tasks
    - a taskboard contains each of these tasks and their status this provides an easy way to communicate about work during the course of the sprint
    - a task is a unit of work that can be accomplished by one or two team members - usually somthing that'll take less than half a day
        - if a task takes longer than that, it is helpful to break that task down to smaller tasks
    - a taskboard contains three headings for tasks to be placed under
        - __To Do__
        - __Doing__
        - __Done__
- __Definition of "Done"__
    - tasks are complete
    - code is reviewed
    - item is tested
    - reviewed with stakeholders
    - product owner reviews conditions of acceptance
    - anything else the team agrees on to include in the definition of done
- __The Sprint Product__
    - work that is done is included in the sprint product
    - the sprint product is the working software the team produces in each sprint and only includes the items that are done
