__What is Usability?__
    - __how easy it is to use__
    - includes the various parts of the interface, such as buttons and links
    - the organization of the content
    - bringing it all together with menus and navigation that are clear and effective
    - __in the end, the usability of what you are building has a direct correlation to the user's ability to get things done and to be satisfied__
    - providing positive interaction, building trust, and allowing users to be successful
    - __User Centered Approach__
        - instead of focusing exclusively on the wants and needs of the company or ourselves, we focus on the wants and needs of the user
    - Usability isn't completely measurable
        - requires qualitative and quantitative data
            - i.e. website analytics and SEO results as well as more opinion-based feedback such as the responses from user interviews or testing
    - Usability is influenced by feelings, experience, and human nature so __it is important to factor in opinions as well as hard numbers__
    - When users use your site they usually have a goal in mind - to read something, buy something, download something, etc.
    - __the amount of effort it takes to find that content will factore into how usable they find the site__
        - confusing links, hard-to-find content or some other unexpected detours can affect the user's willingness to keep using the site
    - __Effort vs. Value__
        - _if the site proves to be not as useable as they'd hoped and takes too much effort when weighted against the value of the content they want, they will leave_
        - __Performance affects Usability__
