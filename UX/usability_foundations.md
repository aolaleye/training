__What is Usability?__
- __how easy it is to use__
    - includes the various parts of the interface, such as buttons and links
    - the organization of the content
    - bringing it all together with menus and navigation that are clear and effective
- __in the end, the usability of what you are building has a direct correlation to the user's ability to get things done and to be satisfied__
- providing positive interaction, building trust, and allowing users to be successful
- __User Centered Approach__
    - instead of focusing exclusively on the wants and needs of the company or ourselves, we focus on the wants and needs of the user
    - Usability isn't completely measurable
        - requires qualitative and quantitative data
            - i.e. website analytics and SEO results as well as more opinion-based feedback such as the responses from user interviews or testing
    - Usability is influenced by feelings, experience, and human nature so __it is important to factor in opinions as well as hard numbers__
    - When users use your site they usually have a goal in mind - to read something, buy something, download something, etc.
    - __the amount of effort it takes to find that content will factore into how usable they find the site__
        - confusing links, hard-to-find content or some other unexpected detours can affect the user's willingness to keep using the site
    - __Effort vs. Value__
        - _if the site proves to be not as useable as they'd hoped and takes too much effort when weighted against the value of the content they want, they will leave_
        - __Performance affects Usability__

__Usability Needs__
- Efficient, fast and reliable designs
- Accessible content across channels
- Important features must work on all devices

__The First Impression__
- When a page loads, users will ask themselves very basic questions:
    - _Is this where I want to be?
    - Is this what I expected?
    - Does the site look trustworthy?
    - Do I understand where things are?
    - Can I figure out where to go first for what I want?_
- Even visiting familiar sites will yield the same questions:
    - _Is everything where it was yesterday?
    - Does everything work the same?
    - Do I know where the new information can be found?
    - Can I understand why something is different?_
- When a user visits a site, they are looking for a reason to leave the site
- it is important to match the user's expectations to the reality of what they find on the site
    
__Architecture and Menus__
- organizing content on a website is a vital part of usability and anticipating user needs by understanding how and where they will look for content
- most website provide a main navigation menu at the top
- __Common Menu Links__
    - Products and Services
    - About
    - Help
    - Contact
    - sometimes Location
- you can check out competitors to give you clues on the common information that is included in a menu

__Color and Images__
- color palletes and use of images can help benefit the overall usability experience
- __A common practice when adding color to a site is to base it off of a logo__
    - using colors from the logo can help provide a consistent look, also improving the branding of the site
    - keeps users familiar with the colors they're going to see when viewing your products and other marketing materials
- __It's also important to use specific colors for calls to action__
    - when you want users to click on a button, especially important ones that will potentially lead to purchases or signups, you want to make sure the button standsout
        - don't make the buttton a neutral color or a color that is too simple to the background
        - choose something that is bright and vibrant and creates a contrast separating it from the text in that section
        - you can take cues from your branding

__Text Content__
- __the most important reason to visit a website comes down to what's in the text__
- you must ensure you provide great content - readable conent - and enough of it to satify your users
- you have to describe:
    - Who you are
    - What you do
    - What you've got to offer
    - How users can get it
 - it's important to consider the content first before creating the structure of the pages
