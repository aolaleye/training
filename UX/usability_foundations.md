__What is Usability?__
- __how easy it is to use__
    - includes the various parts of the interface, such as buttons and links
    - the organization of the content
    - bringing it all together with menus and navigation that are clear and effective
- __in the end, the usability of what you are building has a direct correlation to the user's ability to get things done and to be satisfied__
- providing positive interaction, building trust, and allowing users to be successful
- __User Centered Approach__
    - instead of focusing exclusively on the wants and needs of the company or ourselves, we focus on the wants and needs of the user
    - Usability isn't completely measurable
        - requires qualitative and quantitative data
            - i.e. website analytics and SEO results as well as more opinion-based feedback such as the responses from user interviews or testing
    - Usability is influenced by feelings, experience, and human nature so __it is important to factor in opinions as well as hard numbers__
    - When users use your site they usually have a goal in mind - to read something, buy something, download something, etc.
    - __the amount of effort it takes to find that content will factore into how usable they find the site__
        - confusing links, hard-to-find content or some other unexpected detours can affect the user's willingness to keep using the site
    - __Effort vs. Value__
        - _if the site proves to be not as useable as they'd hoped and takes too much effort when weighted against the value of the content they want, they will leave_
        - __Performance affects Usability__

__Usability Needs__
- Efficient, fast and reliable designs
- Accessible content across channels
- Important features must work on all devices

__The First Impression__
- When a page loads, users will ask themselves very basic questions:
    - _Is this where I want to be?
    - Is this what I expected?
    - Does the site look trustworthy?
    - Do I understand where things are?
    - Can I figure out where to go first for what I want?_
- Even visiting familiar sites will yield the same questions:
    - _Is everything where it was yesterday?
    - Does everything work the same?
    - Do I know where the new information can be found?
    - Can I understand why something is different?_
- When a user visits a site, they are looking for a reason to leave the site
- it is important to match the user's expectations to the reality of what they find on the site
    
__Architecture and Menus__
- organizing content on a website is a vital part of usability and anticipating user needs by understanding how and where they will look for content
- most website provide a main navigation menu at the top
- __Common Menu Links__
    - Products and Services
    - About
    - Help
    - Contact
    - sometimes Location
- you can check out competitors to give you clues on the common information that is included in a menu

__Color and Images__
- color palletes and use of images can help benefit the overall usability experience
- __A common practice when adding color to a site is to base it off of a logo__
    - using colors from the logo can help provide a consistent look, also improving the branding of the site
    - keeps users familiar with the colors they're going to see when viewing your products and other marketing materials
- __It's also important to use specific colors for calls to action__
    - when you want users to click on a button, especially important ones that will potentially lead to purchases or signups, you want to make sure the button standsout
        - don't make the buttton a neutral color or a color that is too simple to the background
        - choose something that is bright and vibrant and creates a contrast separating it from the text in that section
        - you can take cues from your branding

__Text Content__
- __the most important reason to visit a website comes down to what's in the text__
- you must ensure you provide great content - readable conent - and enough of it to satify your users
- you have to describe:
    - Who you are
    - What you do
    - What you've got to offer
    - How users can get it
- it's important to consider the content first before creating the structure of the pages  
- assembling the important text first in a logical, readable and accessible way will allow you to design something that supports the consumption of that content
- __typography involves considering proper line heights, white space, text size, alignment and structuring the text in a readable, logical way__
- colors must also be considered so your text remains readble on different backgrounds
- color blindness also affects a subset of users, so designers often __avoid the combinations of red and green__ together whenever possible
- an example of bad usability is getting an error message that doesn't provide a solution, it just gives the option to either close or continue with that error
    - good usability provides a path to that solution

__Navigation and Interaction__
- things that look like links, such as underlined text, should act like links
    - if they don't, the user is going to be confused
- that means recognizing that anything with a button shape, certain images, and __anything that looks clickable should be clickable__
- on navigation bars and menus, be sure to stick to easy-to-understand terms
    - consider the simplest term that your users will think of when they're looking for that content
    - i.e. if you want to show off your portfolio, name the linke "Portfolio", or for products and services, name it "Products and Services"
- in addition to helpful navigation, you also want to offer interesting and interactive ways for your users to explore and engage with your site
    - i.e. a rotating carousel of images
- __reduce the number of clicks it takes to get everywhere__
    - the easier everything is to find, the better the chances are that users will use your site
- __Call to Action__
    - a link that we want people to click to ensure that they do something important

__Devices and Screen Size__
- it's important to consider the small screen first so you can focus on the core components of your app or your site
    - _it's easier to add rather than subtract_ when scaling design to across devices

__Location and Time__
- tying into location-based content is a great way to improve the usability of your app
    - simply using the device's location information and bringing up the location content can improve usability and user satisfaction
- some apps can also combine location and time data to tell you where their locations are and if they are open at that given time
- __instead of asking the user for a zip code for a store locator, you can already get that information from the device__ and just get the user's permission to access that location data

__Content Prioritization__
- if we want to ensure that our designs are usable, we should __understand what our users will want to do, consume or create__
- don't bury content behind navigation or additional links, put it front and center
- __Creation vs Consumption__
    - if your users are __creating content__, it means they want to produce some texts, take pictures or videos, and potentially refine that content for posting or sharing it
    - if your user is __consuming content__, it means they are comsuming information

__Data and Analytics__
- __Quantitative Data__
    - numeric information that you can collect through things like tracking apps or surveys or other statistical programs
    - it can tell you things like _the number of people visiting the site, the number of email replies your campaign received, the number of products you sold or the number of Facebook likes you generated_
    - this kind of data can allow you to make assumptions about behaviors or outcomes and perhaps predict future performance
- __Qualitative Data__
    - refers to information that more descriptive and open-ended
    - while quantitative data might tell you that you sold 10 cupcakes today, qualitative data might reveal how those sales were received and if you can expect more or less sales tomorrow
    - an example could be _customers giving feedback through a Facebook comment, stating the new cupcake flavor was great and really tasty_

__Usability Testing__
- usability testing allows you to test your site or app with almost anybody using any kind of device
- __the goal _should not_ be to test every single piece of your design or functionality, it should be to collect qualitative data to understand how the most vital parts of your site or app work when you consider how the average person uses it__
- without testing your designs periodically throughout the entire developement cycle, you run the risk of missing some easy fixes that could turn into big problems when left unattended
    - _the further into your design process you are, the more difficult it is to make changes_
- the key to understanding users is figuring out what they want to do on your site or app
    - retail sites want to give users the ability to find products, detailed information, and the ability to make a purchase
    - social apps want to give users the ability to see latest updates, find their friends and share content
    - __you should be prioritizing this content and these features with specific users and tasks in mind__

__Stay Current__
- monitor analytics
- regular testing
- update your code
