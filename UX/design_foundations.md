__Understanding the Different Types of Design__
- __The 3 Principles of Architecture (Vitruvius)__
  1. __Durability__
    - it should last
  2. __Usability__
    - it should have purpose
  3. __Beauty__
    - it should appear delightful
- __Graphic Design__
  - the design of visual communication
  - where we can take a message and correlate it with the elements of art to relay a message
  - where we can change peoples' perception or thoughts on a particular message
  - _"turning a want into a need"_
- __Web/Mobile Design - User Interface__
  - there are two levels of desing when dealing with web a mobile design:
  1. __the design of the content__
    - which you are there to see
  2. __the design of the interface (UI Design)__
    - designing specifically for the user's interactions - meaning you have the content already in hand and are you are performing the task of serving that content up
    - presenting the user with the best possible solution for them to view and interact with the content
- __Systems Design - User Experience__
  - defining objects and how the interaction presents and forms data - thus a system based on requirements
  - can be comprised of multiple mediums

__Great Designers__

    - motion graphics, title sequences, corporate logos
    - corporate identites for many big companies
  - Erik Spiekermann
    - known as one of the best typographers
  - Dieter Rams
    - industrial designer that send the ground work for the term "user friendly"
    - created the Ten Principles of Good Design
      - Good Design...
        1. is innovative
        2. makes a product useful
        3. is aesthetic
        4. makes a product understandable
        5. is unobtrusive
        6. is honest
        7. is long-lasting
        8. is thorough down to the last detail
        9. is environmentally friendly
        10. is as little design as possible
        
__Understanding Aesthetics__
- __Format, Line & Shape__
  - __Format__
    - _the blank substance all designs start out with - whether it be a blank piece of paper or a blank file_
    - these formats all have size and shape even if its digital
    - this space is called the "format of the design" - where everything is arranged
    - the format of the design can portray the overall mood of the design
    - __the format always needs to be considered before beginning the design__
    - every two-dimensional design has two parts:
      1. __Picture Plane__
        - the space where the design is taking place
      2. __the Frame__
        - the outer edge of the picture plane
        - specifies where the design ends
        - the frame can be visible or implied
        - it can have a visual indicator or a contrast
  -__Line__
    - a long narrow mark or band passing through a point
    - __Point__
      - in most cases a line has a beginning and end point
      - the connection between the start and stop points is the line
      - you can have multiple points in one path
    - __Arc__
      - a line that has two points, but the line can bend away from the points, then reaching the end point
    - Thickness = Weight
    - Distance from start to stop = Length
    - There are different variations to lines:
      - __Organic__
      - __Symmetrical__
      - __Rough__
      - __Jagged__
    - __Line Variety__ is a mixture of these variations
    _ __Contour Lines__ - creating illustrations just using lines
    - We can have _organized_ or _unorganized_ lines
    - You can use _negative space_ to show where a line may be
    - When dealing with graphic dsign, a lot of designers use a __Grid__ - which is comprised of horizontal and vertical lines
- __Size & Texture__
  - __Size__
    - a quality of the primary visual elements line and shape
    - all elements have a definitive size, which is its measurable form
  - __Scale__
    - the difference between two objects or in comparison to a standard
    - scale allows us to indiate if something is too small or too large
    - if we're referring to the harmony of 2 objects in comparison, this is __defining the proportion__
      - this is judged by the ratio of scale from one comparison to 2 or more objects
  - __Texture__
    - the quality of feel, appearance or consistency of an object or objects
    - every shape and line has texture
    - there's _implied texture_, like legos, or there's _visual texture_, which is different than implied as there is no touch
    - implied = touch
  - __Pattern__
    - a repeated decorated design
    - patterns are broken up into a _motif_
    - when we repeat a motif, we have constructed a pattern
- __Color__
  - the way light reflects off an object
  - color can define a shape, portray emotion or emphasize an object
  - measured by hue, saturation, and value
  - when we name a color by description, we are describing the color's hue
  - color __sensations__ are used to categorize hues - such as hot, warm or cold colors
  - __monochromatic__
    - of the same color, or one color
    - when a group of colors are the same hue, tint, tone and shade
  - __tint__
    - a mixture of color with white
    - _highlights_
  - __shade__
    - a mixture of color with black
    - _shadows_
  - __tone__
    - in the middle between tint and shade
    - a mixture of grey, or tinting and shading at the same time
  - __primary colors__
    - red, yellow, blue
  - __analog or secondary colors__
    - when we exist two pre-existing colors to form another color
    - _i.e. red + yellow = orange_
  - __complementary colors__
    - on the color wheels, colors that are directly opposite of each other
    - complementary colors are of the highest contrast from one another
  - __triad colors__
    - 3 colors of equal distance from one another on the color wheel
    - _i.e. green, pink & light blue_
  - __saturation__
    - the intensity, strength and chroma of the color
    - colors that have high saturation are described as vibrant and bright
    - colors that have low saturation are described as dull and pale
    - saturation can be scaled from low to high
      - as colors decreases in saturation, it takes the appearance of grey
      - colors that are high in saturation are __chromatic__
      - __neutral__ colors have minimal saturation - warm and cool colors
      - __achromatic__ colors are colors that have no saturation whatsoever - white, black & grey
  - __value__
    - refers to the lightness and darkness of a color
    - can also be measured by scale from white to black - thus, shades of grey between
    - the comparison of shades is the indicator of measurement and determines the value
    - _value comparisons_ - white to black or black to white
    - _color comparisons_ - yellow to purple or vice versa
    - the value scale is comprised of tints, shades and tone, these can also be measured by __keys__
      - a __high key__ refers to a very light-dominant design
      - an __intermediate key__ refers to the mid-range value design
      - a __low key__ refers to a dark value design
      - the entire value scale is referred to as the __total range of the design__
        - __low scale__ is known as low range or low contrast
        - __high scale__ is known as high range or high contrast
    - __simultaneous contrast__
      - neighboring colors that cause change in your perception 
      - lighter becomes darker, and darker becomes lighter when in comparison
    - __optimal mixing__
      - this is done when contrasting 2 colors to give the effect of 1 color
      - your perception of the contrast evens the color out in comparison
- __Composition__
  - the placement or arrangement of visual elements or ingredients in a layout
  - __Structure__
    - the way that composition is organized
    - we look at the structure as a blueprint of the composition
    - the structure can be loose or rigid
    - the _foreground_ and _background_ are crucial when composing a composition
      - the __figure-ground__
        - the relationship between foreground and background - where both elements are dependent of one another
  - __Composition Techniques__
    - __Rule of Thirds__
      - a way to cut the composition up into nine different sections and use the opposing sections to balance one another or to highlight a specific element
    - __Rule of Odds__
      - an odd number of objects is more pleasing to the eye than an even number
    - __Rule of Space__
      - creating movement in a composition
- __Space & Grouping__
  - __Space__
    - in a two-dimensional design creates a third-dimension
    - we can achieve this illusion through depth    
  - __Ambiguous Space__
    - when we are questionable or think there are two or more possible meanings to the actual layout, it is ambiguous or questionable space
  - __Impossible Space__
    - when shapes just don't make sense
  - __Atmospheric Perspective__
    - creating depth through space
  - __Linear Perspective__
    - when we take a straight line and add 2 points on either side, called vanishing points, and we are able to create a third dimensional object
  - __White Space__
    - refers to the comparison of elements within a composition
- __Grouping__
  - the unity or connection of two or more objects
  - _i.e. touching, overlapping, transparency, union - if the objects form a new singular object, intersecting - if the objects cancel out each other, intersection - the cancelled out piece_
  - __Proximity__
    - measurement between objects
  - __Similarity__
    - continiuity in size, shape, color, and space
  - __Common Fate__
    - objects moving in the same direction belong together
  - __Famililarity__
    - if objects create another object
