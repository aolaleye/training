- __Web/Mobile Design - User Interface__
  - there are two levels of desing when dealing with web a mobile design:
  1. __the design of the content__
    - which you are there to see
  2. __the design of the interface (UI Design)__
    - designing specifically for the user's interactions - meaning you have the content already in hand and are you are performing the task of serving that content up
    - presenting the user with the best possible solution for them to view and interact with the content
- __Systems Design - User Experience__
  - defining objects and how the interaction presents and forms data - thus a system based on requirements
  - can be comprised of multiple mediums

__Understanding Aesthetics__
- __Format, Line & Shape__
  - __Format__
    - _the blank substance all designs start out with - whether it be a blank piece of paper or a blank file_
    - these formats all have size and shape even if its digital
    - this space is called the "format of the design" - where everything is arranged
    - the format of the design can portray the overall mood of the design
    - __the format always needs to be considered before beginning the design__
    - every two-dimensional design has two parts:
      1. __Picture Plane__
        - the space where the design is taking place
      2. __the Frame__
        - the outer edge of the picture plane
        - specifies where the design ends
        - the frame can be visible or implied
        - it can have a visual indicator or a contrast
  -__Line__
    - a long narrow mark or band passing through a point
    - __Point__
      - in most cases a line has a beginning and end point
      - the connection between the start and stop points is the line
      - you can have multiple points in one path
    - __Arc__
      - a line that has two points, but the line can bend away from the points, then reaching the end point
    - Thickness = Weight
    - Distance from start to stop = Length
    - There are different variations to lines:
      - __Organic__
      - __Symmetrical__
      - __Rough__
      - __Jagged__
    - __Line Variety__ is a mixture of these variations
    _ __Contour Lines__ - creating illustrations just using lines
    - We can have _organized_ or _unorganized_ lines
    - You can use _negative space_ to show where a line may be
    - When dealing with graphic dsign, a lot of designers use a __Grid__ - which is comprised of horizontal and vertical lines
