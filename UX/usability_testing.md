__Usability Testing__
- Benefits and purpose
- What happens before you test
- What happens during a test
- What will happen after a test
- Some ways to take testing to the next level

__Purpose and Benefits__
- Improve design and development
- Pinpoint specific features and properties
    - making sure that the essential features are working
- Gain outside perspective
- Ensure that your site/app is working properly

__Before You Test__
- __Need access to working site/app__
    - you can ask an opinion about a mockup or desing, but to get the most relevant and actionable information that you can, you have to have something that is working
- __Determine tasks to test__
    - test the process that will lead to the outcome/success you want
    - don't go crazy and test every single feature or page from the site
- __Identify personas__
    - _who is going to use your site?_
    - _who uses your site right now?_
    - if your site is about a particular kind of content, it'll clearly be people that like that content
    - i.e. if it's a site about the greates movie villains of all time, it is people who love movies, people who love entertainment
    - if it's a site about learning how to code, it's people learning to code or refreshing their skills
    - __figure out based on their needs and their interests, as well as any demographic data
        - _male or female?_
        - _particular age group?_ 
        - _are they educated?_
        - _do they live in a certain part of the world? do they live in certain part of your town?_
        - __you want to target those people who would generally use your site or that you would want to use your site to test your site in order to get the most insightful data you can__
            - if you have people that wouldn't normally use your site testing it, the information is not quite as valuable
                - _however, testing with one person is always better than testing with nobody_
- __Locate a place in which to test__
    - you want to have a controlled environment
        - if you want to test in a public place, like a coffee shop, you're going to have distractions
        - but if you have a conference room in your office or even a closed off area in your house, you can control that space because you know you won't have the distractions of the outside world

__Setting Up Your Test__
- __Find & setup your test environment and equipment__
    - make sure you have access to the test location on the day of the test
    - if you need access to a development version of a site, talk with the developers and make sure you have access to it
- __Draft test users and determine compensation__
    - _i.e. When the instructor was testing teamtreehouse.com, he didn't want to use those that worked at the company as they already knew a lot about the website. He wanted to get people that were relatively or completely new to the site._
    - _The way that he reached out to find people was by going to meetup.com and put out a call for test users. He gave instructions, "I'm looking for people who are interested in web design or development or making apps. I'm looking for people who are not members of our site and can you give me an hour of your time on X date"_
    - _He received about 10 - 12 responses_
        - _through surveymonkey.com, he was able to set up a survey and ask them questions_
        - _have you been to the site before?_
        - _what technologies are you interested in?_
            - _he listed a number of things offered on the site, as well as a few things that are not_
        - _what is your availability?_
    - _From that information he was able to schedule 6 people - an hour each - 3 before lunch and 3 after, and he was able to bring them all in a get great information_
    - That is how you can find people that meet the criteria that is set
- __Speak with other team members__
    - it's important not to insulate yourself from the rest of the team
    - you can get some insight as to what other departments want to test
- __Write up your testing script__
    - a script can put you and the test subject at ease
        - check out __"Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug__
- __Compensate users for their time__
    - could be $50 or $100, a gift card or cash
    - maybe a free membership or discount to the site you're testing

__During Your Test__
- __Prep your controlled space__
    - get everything ready - laptop, mobile devices, print out forms like recording consent forms, compensation
- __Start recording__
    - if you don't record the test, you're missing out on something
    - recording what happens on the screen, the person's face is very helpful after the fact
        - being able to recount what the test subject was doing, what they were talking about, where their mouse was going, body language, any mistakes they make, etc. can easily be missed as you're administrating the test
    - __Camtasia 2__ - great tool for screen recording and testing
- __Use your script and take notes__
    - make whatever notes you want inside the script
    - you can make a note in your script to start and stop recording
    - try to take notes as much as you can during the test
- __Listen and engage test users__
    - you have to make the experience as pleasing and effortless for the test users
    - be sure to engage the users and ask them questions about themselves - not simply make them feel like lab rats
    - to ease nervous participants
        - _"Don't worry, you are not the one being tested. The site is being tested and you are here to give us the great benefit or your opinion and feedback and we really appreciate it"_
- __Have a backup plan__
    - such as a test user not showing up
        - overcompensate for the amount of test users you actually need - __3 to 5 is statistically about the perfect range__
    - if the wifi is slow that day and there are videos on the site, have the videos downloaded on your laptop for alternative viewing'

__After Your Test__
- __Review recordings and notes__
    - should be something you do fairly quickly
- __Produce a lst of results__
    - by going through the recordings and the notes, you will start to see patterns
        - such as, "I asked them to do this, and they were able to accomplish it"
    - __share positive results, not just things that need to be fixed__
- __Generate recommendations__
    - recommendations could be the difference between your efforts actually turning into something or not
    - being able to take what you've done and translate it into something actionable goes a long way toward fixing the site
    - __reporting issues in a site is a good first step, but suggesting a fix can be even better__
        - the fix may not be the right thing, but it can lead to the correct fix
    - you can break down recommendations into different categories
        - absolute needs that need to be fixed or changed, as well as a wish list
        - short-term recommendations vs long-term recommendations
            - _"here are some quick, easy fixes that you can knock out in a day"_
            - _"here's a list of other things that are going to take a lot more time and effort"_
- __Share results with your team__
    - share results with the teams that would be interested in it so they can see the value in the testing
- __Schedule the next set of tests__    
    - if you test once a month or once every other month, that can lead to a great process internally during design and development or even after the launch - leading up to further redesigns or rollouts of other features
    - you don't have to test the exact same things each time
        - you can test the most important thing, but also there may be other parts of the site that could use some attention or new features

__The Next Level__
- __Test competitor sites/apps__
    - experiences from other sites can give you more information and gain insight
- __Add automated tools__
    - to track user sessions and give some more data
- __Paid services__
    - help set up usability tests
    - more detail, quicker
    - i.e. UserTesting, IntuitionHQ, Verify (from Zurb)
