__The Foundation of UX__
- __User Centered Design (UCD)__
  - process in which the needs, wants and limitations of end-users of a product are given extensive attention in each stage of the design process
  - answers questions about users and their tasks and goals and then uses the findings to make decisions about development and design
  - __Key questions UCD must answer__
    1. Who are the users?
    2. What are the users' tasks or goals
    3. What are the users' experience levels?
    4. What functions or information do users need?
    5. How do users think the product should work?
  - UCD is __different__ than _participatory design_ - where we attempt to include all stakeholders in the process
  - UCD focuses on the _persona_ - _behavioral representation of a user type_ (also used as a term for a UX deliverable)
- __Graphical User Interface (GUI)__
  - visual way of interacting with computers using items such as windows, icons, and menus
  
__Why UX is important to creating products and services__
- Age of Experience
  - we are now in an age where companies have great holistic user experiences
  - __What makes a great experience?__
    - great experience design is _invisible_, _cultural_, and _multidisciplinary_
    - great experiences are _holistic_
      - they take into account not only the user and their needs but also think about supporting a business cause and take into account the technology available at the time
    - great experiences extend beyond the interface of a product into a multichannel world where you are getting the same message from the same company no matter where you intersect with them 
    - _i.e. when you consider Apple, one knows they are getting quality product whether on the website or in the store. Apple's message of excellence and forward-thinking excudes from whatever touchpoint the user interacts with
  
__UX Disciplines__
- __Visual Design__
  - sometimes called _graphic design_, visual design is the discipline which deals with the aesthetic, visual narrative, colors, types, box model and consistency needed to lay out the story of a site, app or other product of service
- __Information Architecture__
  - the discipline that uses information to create a structure for the user's experience through and between channels i.e. a site, a map, or company message
  - on a small scale - defining the navigation
  - on a large scale - the information flow across channels and products
- __Content Strategy__
  - the discipline which focuses on planning, developing and maintaining the specific content that will populate the information structures that were defined in the informaton architectures
- __Interaction Design__
  - the field that looks at defining the interaction model and narrative that will guide the user through the product or service
  - at times includes some front-end developement
  - ensures that the way the user interacts with the site is always consistent
- __Usability__
  - the discipline that involves validating interfaces, flows and overall products to ensure we are checking in with our user throughout the process and making sure our products meet their needs and are easy to use
-__User Research__
  - the discipline that involves going out and observing users, their behavior and analyzing what their needs, goals and tasks are

__Problem Solvers__
  - UXers are problem solvers first, and designers second
  - To solve a problem, a UXer must
    - _understand the users of the solution to the problem_
    - _understand the content needed for the solution_
    - _understand the context of the problem and the necessary solution_
  - Understanding the problem
    - _How will my success be defined?_
    - _Will this solution have to lead to another?_
    - _Are there other projects that could influence mine?_
    - _What is the worst thing that could happen here?_
    - _Who else has solved this problem? How?_

__Understanding Users and Content__
- strive to better understand _what the user_ of the thing we build _needs_ from the thing we build _in order_ for the thing we build _to solve the user's problem_
- Steps to follow
  1. __Identify the specific users__ of the thing we are building - understanding some of the demographics of the users we want to study, such as age, salary, marital status - but more importantly, understanding what behaviors we're looking to understand about our users 
    - for example, do we want to understand what charities our users donate to? If so, we are looking for people that (1) use our products and (2) give to charities.
  2. __Gather data about our users__
    - using Qualitative Means or Quantitative Means, either way it is referred to as _user research_
    - User Research can involve
      - __user interviews__ - where you talk to users about how they use simillar products, what they like abouth those products, and what is missing from those products
      - __quantitative data__ - like analytics and logs to understand what information users are looking at and where they are having site or product issues. You can send out surveys or use marketing segmentation data to start to gather more data
  3. __Analyzing the research__
    - define the different behavioral types, different actions taken
    - an example of two different behavioral types with the web are _those who search_ and _those who browse_
    - be able to answer this important question to confirm that you understand your users:
      - _What is it that the product we are working on provides this behavior type?_
    - for example, for _those who search_, we know that our product needs to provide a way to search quickly and efficiently while allowing one to manipulate those search results 
  4. __Understanding the content you need to have in order to facilitate solving the user's problem__
    - content can be videos, articles, and pictures - but it is also any piece of information that is being exchanged with the product i.e. ads, forms, etc.
    - a UXer must determine what content the user needs from the product in order to solve their problem, reach their goals, and complete their tasks
  
__Understanding Context__
- Uxers need a way to govern which content and information the user should see and when in order to help facilitate their ideal experience with out product
- Types of Context
  - __Environmental Context__
    - what environment or setup is the user in when they use our solution
      - _Is our product a mobile application that people will be using while traveling?_
      - _Are they likely to be in a hotel on a crappy WiFi connection?_
      - _Are users that use our product using it in times of distress, like when putting in an automobile claim for insurance?_
  - __Context in the details__
    - _When on this page, what details has the user already entered and/or seen before?_
    - _What information or content can we reuse? What do we have to explain new?_
- for both types of context, we are trying to establish an empathetic point of view, so we can piece together an experience that is fluid and user-centric
- __the ultimate goal is to decrease the user's cognitive load, so that their anxiety when using our product is lessened, and their delight is heightened__ - getting information in the right place at the right time
- by understanding the context of where, when and how people will use your product, you can try to predict what information they'll need and when they'll need it thereby helping them to achieve their goals

__Scenerio__
- You are a ux designer at an auto insurance company. A man who is insured with your company gets into a car accident. His car is damaged and he needs to report a claim. 
- __What we know:__
  - this is a nerve-racking situation, he is anxious
  - he wants to get the claim done as quickly as possible so he can receive insurance money to fix his car
  - this is something he may want to get done on the scene of the accident
  - since he is on the scene, we know he is on a phone or other mobile device
  - we also know information about him and his car, since we are his insurer
  - we know what information is needed to input a claim
  - we know the man needs to be reassured and calmed
  - he needs to be rest assured that his claim is being processed
- all of these factors allow us to design a mobile product that is simple and easy to use in the moment and contains all of the information that is needed to submit a claim, is streamlined based on what we already know and has a tone that is comforting and reassuring
- further, we know that we have to update his online accounts across channels like the website and phone customer service so that whenever he contacts our insurance company, he is reassured that we know about and are processing his claim
- we create an experience that facilitates all of this and doing so shows us the power that understanding the user, content and context can bring

__Modeling, Testing and Executing the Experience__
- after coming up with a conceptual solution, we move to modeling that solution in order to show it to others
- __Modeling the Solution__
  - the goal is to tell the story of your solution without showing an interface
- after modeling the solution, UXers move to facilitate the creation of an interface that will allow a user to interact with the content or information in our solution in the given context
  - UXers are not always the one creating interface documents - could be a visual designer or front-end developer who creates the actual deliverable based on your solution model
- after you have something a user can interact with, we'll conduct __Usability Testing__
  - this process can be done by the UXer or a more formal research team
  - the process of testing can be done formally, in a lab or informally - like in your office
  - __you want to test the interface with people who are likely to use your product__
  - __you are testing to ensure that the interface reflection of your solution meets expectations - meaning the correct information in the correct place at the correct time__
  - __you also test to make sure it is easy for end users to complete their tasks and meet their goals and that your solution meets the user's expectations and needs and that this is all possible for the technology team to build within the time and budget you have__
  
__Who UXers work with__
- Business stakeholders (the client)
  - the people whose ideas you are building and who are paying for you to help them
- Developers
  - the people actually building the solution
- Visual Designers
  - the people who are ensuring the branding, aesthetic, layout, etc all match up to what the solution is supposed to be
- QA people
  - separate team of testers or quality assurance folks that make sure the code works
- Copywriters
  - those that write the words to reflect your solution and the company's branding
- Account Managers
  - someone whose job it is to maintain a positive working relationship with the client
- Project Managers
  - the people who make sure the project is on time, on budget and meets business goals
 
__How UXers Think__
- __Systems Thinking__
  - the process of understanding how systems behave, interact with their environment and influence each other
- UXers have to think about the entire system, its parts and processes and how it works
- for example, even the smallest line of text can throw off the narrative of the experience
- Thinking big to think small
  - _What is the purpose of our company?_ (thinking big)
  - _What products do we need to fulfill that purpose and what do those products contain?_ (thinking small)
  - i.e. you have to think about the city before deciding where to put the roads
- __Empathy__
  - the feeling that you understand and share another person's experiences and emotions or the ability to share someone else's feelings
- UXers do user research and observer people in our everyday lives in order t be able to curate the talent of sharing someone else's feelings
- UXers are then able to "be in the user's shoes" while evaluating the experience
- Uxers are in essences the "User Advocate"
- When sitting in a meeting talking about requirements and features, it is the Uxer's job to think...
  - _How does this requirement or feature benefit the user?_
  - _Does it benefit or harm the user?_
  - _How does this feature or requirement help the user reach their goals, fulfill their needs, and complete their tasks?_
- The Uxer uses empathy to put themselves into the user's shoes and answer these questions 
 
__What and who is a User?__
- we are all users
- it is easy to make the mistake of thinking there is only one type of user
- __End User__
  - sometimes referred to as a customer, the end user is ultimately the person that is using, and at times both using and paying for, the product or service you are paying for
- the end user is __NOT__ our only user
  - _everyone that you design for, work with and work for is a user_

__Communication__
- to be a great UXer, you must be a great communicator
- a UXer is the go-between between the business, technology and creatives
- Keys to Good Communication:
  - understand the person you are communicating with
  - understand the information being shared
  - provide context around that information

__Tools for Understanding Users__
- __Conducting User Interviews__
  - recruiting participants
    - can use google forms or survey monkey to put together a series of questions that help you find people that match the criteria you're looking to research
    - Ethnio
      - allows you to put a screener for participants on your site and then get live information to call and conduct interviews
    - you can work with a professional recruitment firms to find the correct people to interview
  - conducting the interview
    - Schedule Thing
      - a tool that allows you to block off times and allows participants to schedule a session
    - user interviews can be done in person or remote
    - you can record conversation for your notes or for the client to tune into when they can't make the session
      - LiveScribe pen and notebook automatically syncs the notes with the audio recording 
      - QuickTime and Audio HiJack Pro for computer based remote interview recordings
  - following up the interview
    - provide a reward for taking the time to interview
      - email gift cards or credit card vouchers
- __Quantitative Analysis__
  - helpful for when there is not enought time to conduct user interviews but user data is still needed
  - __Google Analytics__
    - to understand site usage patterns
  - __Surveys__
    - you can put together a survey that asks many of the same questions you would ask in a user interview
    - great way to get data without having to recruit, schedule and follow up
    - Google Forms and SurveyMonkey are good tools

__Tools for Understanding Content and Context__
- __Card Sorting__
  - method that is often seen as a user research activity
  - gives insights as to how users perceive content - which helps UXers understand where to place content within the product
  - Card sorts are activities that can be done live or remotely in which we have all the pieces of content on cards and ask the users to sort that content into groups - this way we can figure out how users would group content and therefore better organize it for our own product
  - Card sorting tools:
    - OptimalSort
      - a quick, easy tool for remote or in-person card sorts
    - WebSort
    - Index cards and post-its also work in a pinch
- __Search Logs__
  - looking at what terms people are searching for can not only help us to understand what content our users need, but can also help us understand what content they don't
    - Google Analytics
    - In house search log tool
- __Content Inventory__
  - Excel or some other spreadsheet software
