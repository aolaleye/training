__The Foundation of UX__
- __Graphical User Interface (GUI)__
  - visual way of interacting with computers using items such as windows, icons, and menus
- __User Centered Design (UCD)__
  - process in which the needs, wants and limitations of end-users of a product are given extensive attention in each stage of the design process
  - answers questions about users and their tasks and goals and then uses the findings to make decisions about development and design
  - __Key questions UCD must answer__
    1. Who are the users?
    2. What are the users' tasks or goals
    3. What are the users' experience levels?
    4. What functions or information do users need?
    5. How do users think the product should work?
  - UCD is __different__ than _participatory design_ - where we attempt to include all stakeholders in the process
  - UCD focuses on the _persona_ - _behavioral representation of a user type_ (also used as a term for a UX deliverable)
  
__Why UX is important to creating products and services__
- Age of Experience
  - we are now in an age where companies have great holistic user experiences
  - __What makes a great experience?__
    - great experience design is _invisible_, _cultural_, and _multidisciplinary_
    - great experiences are _holistic_
      - they take into account not only the user and their needs but also think about supporting a business cause and take into account the technology available at the time
    - great experiences extend beyond the interface of a product into a multichannel world where you are getting the same message from the same company no matter where you intersect with them 
    - _i.e. when you consider Apple, one knows they are getting quality product whether on the website or in the store. Apple's message of excellence and forward-thinking excudes from whatever touchpoint the user interacts with
  
__UX Disciplines__
- __Visual Design__
  - sometimes called _graphic design_, visual design is the discipline which deals with the aesthetic, visual narrative, colors, types, box model and consistency needed to lay out the story of a site, app or other product of service
- __Information Architecture__
  - the discipline that uses information to create a structure for the user's experience through and between channels i.e. a site, a map, or company message
  - on a small scale - defining the navigation
  - on a large scale - the information flow across channels and products
- __Content Strategy__
  - the discipline which focuses on planning, developing and maintaining the specific content that will populate the information structures that were defined in the informaton architectures
- __Interaction Design__
  - the field that looks at defining the interaction model and narrative that will guide the user through the product or service
  - at times includes some front-end developement
  - ensures that the way the user interacts with the site is always consistent
- __Usability__
  - the discipline that involves validating interfaces, flows and overall products to ensure we are checking in with our user throughout the process and making sure our products meet their needs and are easy to use
-__User Research__
  - the discipline that involves going out and observing users, their behavior and analyzing what their needs, goals and tasks are

__Problem Solvers__
  - UXers are problem solvers first, and designers second
  - To solve a problem, a UXer must
    - _understand the users of the solution to the problem_
    - _understand the content needed for the solution_
    - _understand the context of the problem and the necessary solution_
  - Understanding the problem
    - _How will my success be defined?_
    - _Will this solution have to lead to another?_
    - _Are there other projects that could influence mine?_
    - _What is the worst thing that could happen here?_
    - _Who else has solved this problem? How?_

__Understanding Users and Content__
- strive to better understand _what the user_ of the thing we build _needs_ from the thing we build _in order_ for the thing we build _to solve the user's problem_
- Steps to follow
  1. __Identify the specific users__ of the thing we are building - understanding some of the demographics of the users we want to study, such as age, salary, marital status - but more importantly, understanding what behaviors we're looking to understand about our users 
    - for example, do we want to understand what charities our users donate to? If so, we are looking for people that (1) use our products and (2) give to charities.
  2. __Gather data about our users__
    - using Qualitative Means or Quantitative Means, either way it is referred to as _user research_
    - User Research can involve
      - __user interviews__ - where you talk to users about how they use simillar products, what they like abouth those products, and what is missing from those products
      - __quantitative data__ - like analytics and logs to understand what information users are looking at and where they are having site or product issues. You can send out surveys or use marketing segmentation data to start to gather more data
  3. __Analyzing the research__
    - define the different behavioral types, different actions taken
    - an example of two different behavioral types with the web are _those who search_ and _those who browse_
    - be able to answer this important question to confirm that you understand your users:
      - _What is it that the product we are working on provides this behavior type?_
    - for example, for _those who search_, we know that our product needs to provide a way to search quickly and efficiently while allowing one to manipulate those search results 
  4. __Understanding the content you need to have in order to facilliate solving the user's problem__
    - content can be videos, articles, and pictures - but it is also any piece of information that is being exchanged with the product i.e. ads, forms, etc.
    - a UXer must determine what content the user needs from the product in order to solve their problem, reach their goals, and complete their tasks
  
__Understanding Context__
- Uxers need a way to govern which content and information the user should see and when in order to help facilitate their ideal experience with out product
- Types of Context
  - __Environmental Context__
    - what environment or setup is the user in when they use our solution
      - _Is our product a mobile application that people will be using while traveling?_
      - _Are they likely to be in a hotel on a crappy WiFi connection?_
      - _Are users that use our product using it in times of distress, like when putting in an automobile claim for insurance?_
  - __Context in the details__
    - _When on this page, what details has the user already entered and/or seen before?_
    - _What information or content can we reuse? What do we have to explain new?_
- for both types of context, we are trying to establish an empathetic point of view, so we can piece together an experience that is fluid and user-centric
- the ultimate goal is to __decrease the user's cognitive load, so that their anxiety when using our product is lessened, and their delight is heightened__ - getting information in the right place at the right time
- by understanding the context of where, when and how people will use your product, you can try to predict what information they'll need and when they'll need it thereby helping them to achieve their goals
