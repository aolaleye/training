__Graphical User Interface (GUI)__
- visual way of interacting with computers using items such as windows, icons, and menus

__The Foundation of UX__
- __User Centered Design (UCD)__
  - process in which the needs, wants and limitations of end-users of a product are given extensive attention in each stage of the design process
  - answers questions about users and their tasks and goals and then uses the findings to make decisions about development and design
  - __Key questions UCD must answer__
    1. Who are the users?
    2. What are the users' tasks or goals
    3. What are the users' experience levels?
    4. What functions or information do users need?
    5. How do users think the product should work?
  - UCD is __different__ than _participitory design_ - where we attempt to include all stakeholders in the process
  - UCD focuses on the _persona_ - _behavioral representation of a user type_ (also used as a term for a UX deliverable)
