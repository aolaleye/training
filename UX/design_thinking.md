__Design Thinking__
- gaining insights into your users experience as you design, develop or sell your services to your users
- __AS-IS__
  - what a user is currently experiencing
- __TO-BE__
  - an empathy-based solution that addresses their greatest experience pain points
- __Timeboxing__
  - the act of defining a length of time that a task should take and enforcing those parameters
  - it's not only a means of timekeeping but it also aids in breaking design thinking workshop methods into realistically manageable pieces
- design thinking is centered around your user, but also moving quickly and creatively
- Mindsets vs Methods
  - __You are NOT your user__
    - it is important to separate your own biases and assumptions from the process and learn what your user truly needs
  - __Empathy Map__
    - a design thinking tool made of quadrants that is used to better understand the overarching traits of a user - typically outside of the context of their workflow
    - it can create a "snapshot" of the user mentality
    - empathy maps aren't an exact representation of a single specific human being - they are a way for us to consider a user archetype
  - __Archetype__
    - a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in indvidual psyches
    - i.e. an urban college student is up on the latest tech trends or a rural babyboomer who just became a grandma
    - there are certain things that can be inferred about the lives or habits of an archetype, but _they are just assumptions until we prove them right or wrong_
  - __Journey Map__
    - a means of documenting a user's experience from start-to-finish
    - vary from practitioner to practitioner
    - seek to find a user's pain, their motivations, or design opportunities for a user
    - this may be likened to an empathy map but viewed over the course of an experieince rather than a general view of a user during a single point in time
  - __Pain Points__
    - blockers in a user's experience
    - this may be emotional, technological, process-based or physical
    - severity of pain will vary with each example
  - __Prioritization__
    - defining the importance of action items
  - __Triage__
    - acting upon the prioritized action items taking care of the most important items first
  - __Big Idea__
    - a holistic and open-ended solution to a user's pain based in a user's motivation or needs
  - __Feature__
    - a prescriptive non-holistic response to a user's pain based in technology
  - __Vignette__
    - a brief but descriptive depiction of events
  - __"Getting Caught in the Weeds"__
    - an idiom that refers to being distracted by details and losing sight of the intended purpose
  - __Self-compassion__
    - allowing for kindness and mindful forgiveness of oneself during times of failure
  - __Storyboard__
    - a visual form of storytelling used to show a user's journey
    - comporesed of panels filled with art (high or low fidelity) and accompanying text
- __Presenting your Findings__
  - __Roadmap__
    - a time-based mapping of design decisions and the user impact of those decisions
  - Three things to remember when structuring your stakeholder presentation
    1. Simple Story
      - keep the story tight and easy to follow
    2. Maintain Empathy
      - use your user's name to maintain empathy with your audience and to guide the narrative
    3. Solve the Pain
      - explain how your solution solves your user's pain
  - Time Management
    - be sure to set enough time to better the story so you're telling the points that matter most for you
  - Story First
    - attractive visuals may distract from your story, so consider the fidelity in which you communicate your story
    - if you're early in the process, keep the fidelity low 
    - if you're further along, then higher fidelity images would make sense
  - Getting Feedback
    - go into the presentation with the intent of getting feedback
    - rather than opening up the floor asking for general feedback, begin the Q&A section with fairly directed questions aimed at the top stakeholders
      - this will let them know what you actually want feedback on and you will maintain the ability of actually running the meeting
