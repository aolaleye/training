__Information Architecture (IA)__
- __The way we organize, label, and connect the information on a website or app__
	- Organize content
  		- Organizing content in a logical, easy-to-use way
  	- Label content
    		- Properly name categories and label links within menus that connects users to important info
	- Create connections
		- Create connections between everything so the users can spend more time, consume more content, engage with us more and perhaps buy more stuff
		- A design discipline that is focused on making information findable and understandable
		- Making collections of information easy to locate and easy to understand

__The Role of IA in Web Design and Development__
- IA is the bridge between design and development
	- __Priorities of an information architect__
		1. First, you need to figure out how content will be organized – behind the scenes and on your website
			- For example, when working with writers and other content creators, there could be a writer who calls his blog posts “Weekly Blog Posts” but you know your users are looking for “Weekly Industry Updates”
			- When working with developers, verify that whichever content management system they use supports the content organization and categories you’ve come up with
			- If you need five or ten more sections full of content, you’ll need a system that supports i
			- Or if your website is expanding, you’ll need a system flexible enough to support that
			- If your content types range from text to images to video and beyond, you’ll need a way to organize that content
		2. Understand your users’ needs and expectations
		3. Create site maps
	- Site maps are a visual representation of website pages and sections showing the links between them to help a team understand how it all works
	- To understand the flow of your website and how people on the homepage will naturally find their way to important conversion points like making a purchase or newsletter registration
	- You’ll also want to know how people finding your site through a link or search engine will land in the middle of your site but still be able to find their way easily and still be successful and finding the product info they need
